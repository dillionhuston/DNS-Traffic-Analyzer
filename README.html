# DNS Logger

This is a basic DNS logger designed to capture and analyze DNS queries. Currently in the early stages of development, the project is focused on functionality and collecting DNS data. The goal is to incrementally improve the project by implementing more efficient ways of handling data, including algorithms and multi-threading, in future updates.

The code is a work in progress, and there may be areas that are not optimized or could use improvements. Contributions are always welcome!
